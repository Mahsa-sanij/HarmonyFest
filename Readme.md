* The application is developed using SwiftUI and Combine frameworks based on MVVM architecture.
* Due to application small size, I decided to separate View and ViewModel folders. For larger projects, you can group View and ViewModel files together based on each feature.
* Images have high-resolution. I used downsampling technique to reduce their sizes, but it still takes some time to download the images. Please be patient.
